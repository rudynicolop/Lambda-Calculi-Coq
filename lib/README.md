# Theories

Features:

- Lambda-calculus (plain, without types) (`Vanilla.v`).
- Simply-typed Lambda-calculus (`STLC`).
- System F (`SF`)

I hope to support all vertices of the lambda cube,
but many systems remain unimplemented.

[Lambda-Calculi-Ocaml](https://github.com/rudynicolop/Lambda-Calculi-OCaml)
is a complementary development
featuring student-friendly computable examples.
