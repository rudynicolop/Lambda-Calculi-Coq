# System F

The primary development is `Dep.v` which features

- preservation
- progress

The syntax is type-correct-by-construction
& heavily reliant upon [coq-equations](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations).
`Plain.v` is a supplemental implementation
which serves as a guide to development
some auxilary definitions for the dependent type version.
