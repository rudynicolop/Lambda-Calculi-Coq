# Lambda-Calculi-Coq

Lambda-Calculi implementations &amp; proofs in Coq.

## Features:

- Church-Rossner Confluence of beta-reductions for the untyped lambda calculus.
- Progress, preservation, & strong-normalization of the simply-typed lambda calculus.

## Sources

I borrow heavily from the following for coq-certified de Bruijn notation calculi.
Many techniques & lemmas I employ are not of my own design,
& these repositories are my reference.

- [Coq-In-Coq](https://github.com/coq-contribs/coq-in-coq)

- [Lambda-Calculus](https://github.com/pi8027/lambda-calculus)

For general wisdom on coq-programming I looked to:

- [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/)

- [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/)

And of course, [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) is an important source.
